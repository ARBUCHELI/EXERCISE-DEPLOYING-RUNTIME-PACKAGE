# EXERCISE-DEPLOYING-RUNTIME-PACKAGE

##This Content was Created by Intel Edge AI for IoT Developers UDACITY Nanodegree. (Solution of the exercise and adaptation as a repository: Andr√©s R. Bucheli.)

Deploy the runtime package on the CPU.

In this exercise, we will try to deploy the runtime package we created in the previous exercise on the CPU present in this Workspace. <strong>Note:</strong> This is material
created by Intel and Udacity and you will have to configurate your own workspace and environment to emulate this exercise.

The runtime package of the <code>vtune_project</code> has already been uploaded in the workspace. If you want to deploy your own application, then you can upload it and try it out.

You will find detailed instructions on how to deploy your runtime package [here](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_install_guides_deployment_manager_tool.html).
